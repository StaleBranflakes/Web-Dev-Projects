    <pre>The University of North Carolina at Pembroke is a university with a spirited community of over 7.660 students.
    With a wide array of bachelor’s and master’s degree offerings, fantastic Pembroke faculty, and a diverse community of cultures, ideas and organizations at their fingertips, UNCP students are poised to excel in life.
    Each student is an individual at UNCP. Our students get a chance to make names for themselves — to stand out in a warm and welcoming community that wants them to succeed — and experience a rare combination of opportunities, cultures and ideas that can’t be found anywhere else.</pre>
